\section{Introduction}

When doing operating system work you ideally want to run your experimental software on a
different computer than the one you use for development. An error in an operating system module
or driver has the potential to corrupt the entire machine; testing on your development system
may lead to headaches if such corruption should occur. Also it is generally not possible to
debug an operating system while running the debugger tool on the same machine. Two machines are
needed so the debugger and the debugee can be properly separated.

In this document I call the development system ``DevBox.'' It is a full desktop system with all
the usual tool and conveniences. It is on DevBox where you spend most of your time working and
compiling your programs. It is on DevBox where you run source level debuggers.

The experimental system I call call ``HackBox.'' It is not a full desktop system and instead is
minimally configured. The smaller, lighter configuration makes testing and error recovery
easier.

This document describes how to set up the preconfigured DevBox and HackBox virtual machines I
provide for my operating systems course. I describe how to install the VirtualBox VM software,
how to import and run the DevBox and HackBox virtual machines, and how to exercise the system to
verify that it is set up properly. At the end of this document I include some notes on how
DevBox and HackBox were built. That information is for reference only and not essential for
using the systems.

\section{Installing VirtualBox}

The lab machines at Vermont Technical College should already have the VirtualBox software
installed. If you are using a lab machine you can skip this section and continue with
Section~\ref{sec:booting-guests}. If you intend to run DevBox and HackBox on your personal
machine you will need to first install VirtualBox on your system.

DevBox and HackBox together consume significant resources. Before trying to install them on your
personal machine you should be sure you have at least 6 GiB of memory and at least 50 GiB of
free disk space. You also need to have hardware virtualization support turned on in the BIOS of
your host computer. Most new machines come with this feature turned on by default. Older
machines may require you to enter the BIOS and activate this feature. If your machine is very
old it may not support hardware virtualization at all. Finally, DevBox and HackBox assume that
your host has at least two cores.

If the host does not meet the requirements above it may be possible to reconfigure the virtual
machines so that they will work anyway. However you may have to sacrifice some features or
endure suboptimal performance in that case.

If you still wish to proceed, begin by downloading VirtualBox from
\url{http://www.virtualbox.org}. Be sure to download both the main installer for your system
\emph{and} the Extension Pack. The Extension Pack adds important functionality that DevBox and
HackBox requires. \emph{The virtual machines will likely not boot in their default configuration
  without the Extension Pack installed!}

Run the VirtualBox installer. After the installer completes double click on the Extension Pack
to install that as well.

\section{Booting the Guests}
\label{sec:booting-guests}

DevBox and HackBox are distributed as virtual appliances. This is a standard file format that
includes not only the virtual hard disk (compressed) but also the virtual machine's
configuration. Once you import the virtual appliance into your virtualization software you can
boot a virtual machine by just starting it as you might start a real computer.

The virtual appliance file format is accepted by several different virtualization products.
However, DevBox and HackBox assume they are running under VirtualBox, and, in particular, DevBox
has the VirtualBox ``guest additions'' pre-installed.\footnote{HackBox does not have the guest
  additions installed to simplify its kernel configuration.} The guest additions are a
collection of software components that are loaded into the guest and that streamline the
operation of the system.\footnote{The term ``guest'' refers to the system running inside the
  virtual machine. The term ``host'' refers to the system running the virtualization software.}

You may be able to run DevBox and HackBox using some other virtualization product. However, you
will probably have to do some additional configuration before it will work well. VirtualBox is
the only virtualization software that is officially supported for use in my operating systems
class.

To import the virtual appliances into VirtualBox follow the steps below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download the file \texttt{DevBox-YYYY-MM-DD.ova} and similarly for HackBox. See my web
  site for the locations where these files are currently available. The names of the files
  contain the date when that version was released. I normally release a new version of both VMs
  shortly before the start of each semester.

\item Start VirtualBox and select ``Import Appliance'' from the File menu. Follow the prompts.
  This will unpack the OVA file and add the virtual machine to VirtualBox's start menu. Repeat
  this for both virtual appliance files.

\end{enumerate}

In principle no further configuration is necessary since the configurations of the virtual
machines are contained in their original OVA files. However you might review the machine
settings and tweak them if desired. Note especially the amount of memory allocated to the
virtual machines. \emph{DevBox is configured to use 2.0 GiB of memory and HackBox is configured
  to use 0.5 GiB of memory. If your host computer has less than 6 GiB of memory you may want to
  adjust the configured value downward.} If your host computer is well endowed with memory you
might consider increasing the amount available to the virtual machines. A good rule of thumb is
to allocate no more than 50\% of your system's physical memory to \emph{all} virtual machines
taken together.

After you have imported the appliances you can delete the OVA files to save disk space. However,
if you have sufficient disk space you might consider keeping the files in case you need to
reinitialize DevBox or HackBox from scratch. Having the OVA files on hand will save you another
long download.

It is perfectly reasonable to boot both DevBox and HackBox at the same time; in fact this is
often necessary for the kind of work you'll be doing. Each virtual machine runs in its own
window. DevBox presents a full graphical desktop; HackBox is console only. The Linux
distribution running inside both virtual machines is Ubuntu, 64~bit. DevBox is using the desktop
version of Ubuntu 16.04 and HackBox is using the server version of Ubuntu 16.04.

You will likely have to boot HackBox first if you want the serial consoles to communicate with
each other properly. This is because HackBox's machine configuration sets up its virtual serial
port in server mode; DevBox will probably be unable to connect to it unless it already exists
when DevBox starts. \textit{TODO: Check this!}

Both DevBox and HackBox has a user account named ``student'' with a password of ``frenchfry.''
You should log in as this user. The student user can use \texttt{sudo bash} to create a root
shell when necessary.

\section{Snapshots}

One major benefit to doing your development inside a virtual machine is that you can use
VirtualBox to ``snapshot'' your system just before attempting any kind of dangerous or
complicated operation. When you create a snapshot VirtualBox remembers the entire state of the
system. \emph{Any} change made after the snapshot is provisional. If the system becomes corrupt,
you can just restore to the snapshot and undo all changes made since the snapshot was taken.

The undoing of changes is complete. The process does not rely on the correct operation of the
guest system. Even if the data on the (virtual) hard disk is totally shredded, restoring to a
snapshot will reset every detail of the system back to the state it had when the snapshot was
taken.

With this protection in place you are free to experiment without concern of causing irreparable
damage. For example, if you want to try building and installing a new version of the C
library\ldots\ go ahead! Take a snapshot first and if the result is a major disaster you can
just roll back to where you started and try again. In the worst case scenario you could delete
your virtual machine and re-import it from the original OVA file. Of course this rolls back all
changes you ever made to the system but the base configuration will be fully restored.

It is likely you will snapshot HackBox frequently during your work. This is because HackBox will
be running experimental kernels and kernel modules and is thus subject to random, spectacular
failures. In contrast DevBox should remain fairly stable since it only runs software blessed by
Ubuntu and well established third party products. Because of HackBox's minimal configuration,
snapshots of HackBox should be small and quick to make. This is a nice side effect of using two
machines in this way.

\section{Basic Testing}

It is nice after installing DevBox and HackBox to do some simple operations to verify that they
are working for you in a useful way. Keep in mind that none of the steps described in this
section are necessary for DevBox or HackBox to work. They are only intended to give you an
opportunity to exercise the system in a relevant manner.

\begin{enumerate}

\item If any virtual machine is running, shut it down. If you are not running VirtualBox, start
  the VirtualBox application. Either way, at this point, you should be looking at VirtualBox's
  window that lists your configured virtual machines, but you should have no virtual machine
  actually running.

\item In the VirtualBox console select the HackBox virtual machine and take a snapshot of its
  current state.

\item Boot HackBox. Log in as the user student.

\item Boot DevBox. Log in as the user student. Open a terminal window.

\item Check that you have network connectivity between the two systems. For example, on DevBox
  issue the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ ping hackbox
\end{Verbatim}
  Run the corresponding command on HackBox to ping DevBox.

  Both virtual machines can communicate across an internal network managed entirely by
  VirtualBox. They have statically assigned IP addresses (192.168.56.101 for DevBox and
  192.168.56.102 for HackBox) with appropriate entiries in \texttt{/etc/hosts} allowing the
  machines to communicate via unqualified names. This ping check allows you to verify that this
  network connectivity is functional.

  Both virtual machines also have a second network interface defined that connects via a network
  address translator to the host's physical network interface. This gives both machines access
  to the Internet for updates and other purposes.

\item On DevBox issue the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ ssh hackbox
\end{Verbatim}
  This should connect to the ssh server on HackBox over the internal network and allow you to
  log in again as student. You can use the \texttt{scp} command to transfer files between the
  two systems. Note that DevBox is not running an ssh server so all file transfer commands must
  be initiated from the DevBox side.

  Once you've demonstrated that ssh is working you can log out.

\item On DevBox issue the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ minicom
\end{Verbatim}
  Both HackBox and DevBox also have virtual serial ports defined. Those ports
  (\texttt{/dev/ttyS0} in both cases) have been connected together by VirtualBox. HackBox is
  running a \texttt{getty} process on its ttyS0 serial port to support logins.

  Minicom is a simple terminal program for Linux that can be used to interact with serial ports.
  After starting minicom you should be able to hit Enter and see a login prompt from HackBox.
  Try logging in to verify that this works. We will make use of this serial connection for
  kernel debugging purposes (the network will be non-functional during debugging).

  When you are done experimenting with this, log out of HackBox and then type CTRL+A followed by
  X in minicom to exit minicom.

\item Check that you are using the correct kernel on HackBox by issuing the command (on
  HackBox's console):
\begin{Verbatim}
$ cat /proc/version
\end{Verbatim}
  This command reads a file in the ``magic'' proc file system that, in this case, reports
  information about the kernel version you are using. It should say 3.18.14. This is the
  pre-compiled experimental kernel we will be working with.

\item On DevBox use the file manager to browse
\begin{Verbatim}
/home/student/linux-4.12.8
\end{Verbatim}
  This is the source code for the experimental kernel. You will become familiar with its
  organization in the future, but a quick look now is a good first step toward that goal.

\item On DevBox in a terminal window change to
\begin{Verbatim}
/home/student/linux-4.12.8
\end{Verbatim}
  and issue the command \texttt{make menuconfig} to view the kernel configuration menu. The
  configuration you are looking at is the configuration used the last time the kernel was
  compiled. It represents the current configuration of the experimental kernel running on
  HackBox.\footnote{For full details about how to compile Linux, see my companion document
    \textit{Compiling Linux} in the same repository where you found this document.} Look around
  to see what kinds of options are available. If you change anything, do \emph{not} save your
  changes. If you save any changes you will end up doing a full kernel rebuild the next time you
  try to compile it. That takes a very long time.

  Once you exit the configuration menu, look at the file \texttt{.config} and the file
\begin{Verbatim}
include/generated/autoconf.h
\end{Verbatim}
  to see the results of the configuration process. The \texttt{.config} file is used by the
  kernel build system to control which source files need to be compiled and how. The
  \texttt{autoconf.h} header is included into source files that need to distinguish between
  various configuration options.

\item Edit the file \texttt{init/version.c}\footnote{Relative paths are relative to the root of
    the kernel source tree unless context indicates otherwise.} and change the value of
  \texttt{linux\_proc\_banner} to include some distinctive text. For example you might add
  something like ``experimental'' to the existing banner. This will change the contents of
  \texttt{/proc/version} once the modified kernel is running.

\item Issue the command \texttt{make} at the root of the kernel source tree to build a new
  kernel reflecting your changes. This should not take too long because the kernel has already
  been built and \texttt{make} should realize that most of the object files are up to date (even
  so it can take several minutes to do this). If \texttt{make} appears to be recompiling
  everything something is wrong (possibly you accidentally saved changes when looking the
  configuration earlier). In that case just cancel the build and don't worry about this step.

\item Copy the file:
\begin{Verbatim}
arch/x86/boot/bzImage
\end{Verbatim}
  \emph{to HackBox} and on top of the file:
\begin{Verbatim}
/boot/vmlinuz-4.12.8
\end{Verbatim}
  on that system. This replaces the boot experimental kernel with the version you just compiled
  containing your changed banner. It's good practice to make a backup copy of
  \texttt{vmlinuz-4.12.8} first.

\item Reboot HackBox into the experimental kernel and verify that \texttt{/proc/version} has
  changed as expected. You can use the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ sudo shutdown -r now
\end{Verbatim}
  to reboot HackBox immediately.

\end{enumerate}

When you are done with the steps above you can shutdown HackBox using a command such as:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ sudo shutdown -h now
\end{Verbatim}
Here the \texttt{-h} option means ``halt.'' After the system shuts down you can restore to the
snapshot to undo any changes made during this session and put the system back into its initial
pristine state. You may find it useful to do this after each experiment.\footnote{Avoid storing
  anything of importance on HackBox. Use DevBox for all files you wish to keep.}

Although you will be recompiling the kernel in some labs, most of the programming you'll be
doing will actually be in the form of external kernel modules. These are modules that are not
part of the normal distribution and that are always loaded dynamically. Details about how to do
this will be provided in the appropriate lab.

In addition to Linux we will also be experimenting with an operating system written by a team of
VTC students for their 2008/2009 senior project. That system is called Phoenix. Using Phoenix
does not require HackBox at all. Instead it runs inside a virtualization product called Bochs
running inside the DevBox VM (yes, this amounts to a nested virtual machine).

If you wish to try Phoenix to see if it works for you, follow the steps below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item On DevBox change to the \texttt{Phoenix} directory and do:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ git pull
\end{Verbatim}
  to get the most recent version of Phoenix from GitHub.

\item Type:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ source useOW.sh
\end{Verbatim}
  to configure the environment of your terminal to make the Open Watcom C/C++ compilers
  available. You might want to change the title on the terminal to reflect this so you don't
  forget (use the ``Terminal $\rightarrow$ Set Title'' menu item on the terminal program).

\item Use the \texttt{makeandrun.sh} script in the top level Phoenix folder. That script creates
  a Phoenix boot disk image containing the system and several sample programs, and then launches
  Phoenix using the Bochs simulator. Bochs has been configured with debugging features turned on
  so when it starts it will produce a command prompt. Type ``continue'' to begin the simulation
  without interruption.

  When Phoenix boots you will be prompted with a menu of programs on the boot disk. Select one
  of them to see Phoenix in action. You can power off the Bochs simulation (upper right corner
  of the Bochs window) when you are done. There is no shutdown procedure for Phoenix.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Using KGDB and KDB}

KGDB is a kernel debugger that allows you to connect \texttt{gdb} running on DevBox to the
kernel running on HackBox. Using this tool is a bit intricate. Here I outline the basic
procedure. See the class web page for links to additional information.

When you want to use the debugging tools you must log into HackBox by way of a serial terminal.
Do \emph{not} use SSH and do not use the console. While the HackBox kernel is being debugged the
network will not function normally. Furthermore the debugger on DevBox has no way to transmit
data over the console; it needs to use an old style serial port.

\emph{I recommend taking a snapshot of HackBox before your debugging session in case you
  accidentally trash HackBox during the session!}

On DevBox use the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ minicom
\end{Verbatim}
This command starts the terminal program. It has been preconfigured to connect to
\texttt{/dev/ttyS0} which is attached to HackBox's serial port of the same name by way of a
host-level named pipe. You can hit the Enter key to get a login prompt from HackBox.

When you are ready to debug, you must first activate KGDB on HackBox. Use a command such as:
\begin{Verbatim}
# echo ttyS0 > \
   /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc
\end{Verbatim}
This informs the KGDB ``over console'' driver that it should use ttyS0 for communication.
Without this step KGDB will effectively be turned off even if it has been compiled into the
kernel. Note that this command must be executed at a root shell (using \texttt{sudo} won't
work).

There are three ways to break into the kernel.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the kernel takes an exception it will stop and wait for the debugger to attach.
\item You can issue a SysRq-g sequence in the terminal program.
\item You can echo the letter 'g' into the file \texttt{/proc/\-sysrq-trigger}.
\end{enumerate}

The second option can be done from minicom by typing Ctrl+Afg. Use the following command to
execute the third option:
\begin{Verbatim}
# echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
\end{Verbatim}

After breaking into the kernel you should see a KDB prompt on your terminal. At this point the
kernel on HackBox is frozen awaiting your debugging pleasure. You could enter KDB commands, but
it is generally more interesting to use \texttt{gdb}.

On DevBox in a separate command window, go into the top level of the Linux source tree and use
the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
$ gdb ./vmlinux
\end{Verbatim}
This runs the debugger against the previously compiled kernel image. The debugger will use the
image for symbolic information. Note that you must use the uncompressed kernel image and not
\texttt{vmlinuz}.

Connect the debugger to the ttyS0 serial port with the following commands:
\begin{Verbatim}
(gdb) set serial baud 115200
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0
\end{Verbatim}

You can now use \texttt{gdb} debugging commands to debug the HackBox kernel. Note that you will
see some ``junk'' appearing on the previously opened terminal. They are remote debugging
protocol packets; you can ignore them.

To return to normal operation first exit \texttt{gdb} with the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
(gdb) quit
\end{Verbatim}
You will see a message about terminating the remote process. You can say `yes' here (it doesn't
actually terminate the HackBox kernel). Then, back in the terminal window type:
\begin{Verbatim}
$3#33
\end{Verbatim}
You won't be able to see the text as you type it. This sequence is a debugging protocol packet
that tells KDB to return to the prompt. You can then resume normal operation of HackBox by
issuing the `go' command at the KDB prompt.

\section{Making Backups}

Most recovery operations such as restoring to a snapshot or re-importing the original OVA file
will entail the lose of some or all of your work. Thus I strongly recommend that you back up
your work often. This can be done by using a special backup script I created. To use it simply
execute \texttt{backup} at a command prompt.

It is extremely important to understand that The \texttt{backup} script only archives the files
in the \texttt{cis-4020} folder. This means the backup archives are relatively small but it also
means that any files you put elsewhere on the system will not be backed up. \emph{I therefor
  strongly recommend that you store all course materials in the cis-4020 folder.} Be aware that
configuration changes you make, for example to the desktop on DevBox, are not backed up.

Once the \texttt{backup} script has created the archive it will ask you if you want to tranfer
that archive to \texttt{lemuria}. Assuming you have an account on that system you can use
\texttt{lemuria} as a repository of backups. If you do not transfer the backup file, the script
will leave it in student's home directory where you can transfer it some other way (for example
as an email attachment using webmail).

You should definitely transfer the backup archives off the virtual machine. The point of the
backups are to save your work in case the VM is destroyed. Keeping the backup archives on the VM
won't help you if you lose the state of the VM itself.

Figure~\ref{fig:sample-backup} shows a sample backup session. Text entered by the user is show
in an italic font.

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small, frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}]

student@devbox:~$
\end{Verbatim}
\caption{Sample Backup Session}
\label{fig:sample-backup}
\end{figure*}

Another, more elegant way to transfer a course directory to another host is to use the
\texttt{rsync} program. This program only copies files that have changed and is thus often
faster than transferring an entire archive (even a compressed archive). The \texttt{rsync}
program will add and remove files and directories on the target as necessary and, in archive
mode, it even copies file permissions and date/time information. First move to student's home
directory. Then do
\begin{Verbatim}
$ rsync -vaz --delete -e "ssh -p 2221" \
  cis-4020 username@lemuria.cis.vtc.edu:
\end{Verbatim}

The \texttt{--delete} option tells \texttt{rsync} to remove files on the target that are not in
the source. The \texttt{-z} option specifies compressed mode; this is particularly useful if you
are on a low speed network connection since it will reduce the amount of network traffic
required. See the \texttt{rsync} manual page for more information.

Note that the \texttt{rsync} command above uses ssh as the underlying transport. Thus you will
be prompted for your password, yet your password will not appear on the network unencrypted.
Note also that the \texttt{rsync} command above will create (or update) a \texttt{cis-4020}
directory beneath your home directory on the remote host.

\section{Shutting Down}

When you are finished using the virtual machines \emph{do not just close the VirtualBox window!}
Closing VirtualBox is equivalent to pulling the power on a real machine. Instead you should shut
down the guest operating system properly. On DevBox in the upper right corner of the desktop
there is a menu with a ``Shutdown'' option. On HackBox, as the root user, issue the command:
\begin{Verbatim}
# shutdown -h now
\end{Verbatim}

Alternatively you can suspend the virtual machine. On the VirtualBox menu (not inside the guest)
do ``Machine $\rightarrow$ Close\ldots'' In the dialog box that appears select ``Save the
machine state.'' The next time you start the virtual machine will resume from the saved state.
This is usually quicker than booting the system from scratch.

\section{Setup Notes}

This section contains some notes on how DevBox and HackBox were initially configured. They are
intended to be helpful to anyone else who wants to build the systems from scratch rather than
downloading the preconfigured systems.

\textit{TODO: Finish me!}
