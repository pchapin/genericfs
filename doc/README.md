+ `GenericFS.tex` is the master document for the main GenericFS documentation. To build the PDF,
  compile this document with `pdflatex`.

+ `figures` is a folder for the figures used by the main GenericFS documentation.
  
+ `references.bib` is the BibTeX database for the main GenericFS documentation.
